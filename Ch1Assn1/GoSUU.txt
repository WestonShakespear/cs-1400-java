We will che-er for the red and white, of our fighting SUU!
Hear our battle cry, echo through the sky, As our team comes blazing through!
They will fight, fight, fight, when they hear us shout, As we sing our victory song.
We will run, we will score, till the Thunder Roars, And the T-Birds win once more!
Go, Go, Go,
Fight, Fight, Fight,
Win T-Birds!
