It was the one night everybody dreads, the night before hell week starts - AKA finals week - at Southern Utah University. The library was full of sleepy students all glued to their books and feet deep in energy drink cans and empty coffee cups. One desperate student even had the guts to sneak in a(n) rock. As expected, I couldn't find a decent place to sit so I had to sit next to the dude who smelled like cocaine. I began to jump swiftly. Finally, at around 5 a.m. Monday morning I started wandering back to my dorm room, but my toe was so exhausted that I decided to crash at the library. I was awoken 5 hours later by a not so friendly frog who was gnawing on my notes. "Balderdash! I'm late for my first final!" I yelled. I ran to class as fast as I could, but when I got there and saw no one in class, I realized that my first final was actually a week ago and it was not Monday at all. In fact, it was Friday and not only did I miss all of my finals, but I've been going to the wrong school for 1450 years and am actually a(n) sink. "Oh well," I sighed. "At least I'll always be smarter than Kim."
